# PortfolioProjects
Welcome to my Portfolio!

A bit on my background, I have a B.S. in Economics from Texas A&M University (Class of '22)
While in school, I started a real estate investment company, where I have been working since graduating. Examples of that work are available on my portfolio website.

Active Projects:
Airbnb Data -
 Utilizing data from insideairbnb.com to gather information about the Dallas market. I import, clean, and standardize the data, then describe the data using various metrics and visualizations. Next, I create a linear regression to draw conclusions about how property features affect pricing. Eventually, it will include a machine learning application to cluster hosts and produce stronger regressions and results.
 This is currently a work in progress

Example Projects:
API Data Exercise-
  Gather live data from the YelpAPI, clean, and convert to a Pandas DataFrame. Plotted locations using Folium and manipulated DataFrame to draw conclusions.
  Used to find coffee shop recommendations near a hotel for a trip to Asheville.
