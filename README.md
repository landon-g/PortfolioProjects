# PortfolioProjects
Welcome to my Portfolio!

A bit on my background, I have a B.S. in Economics from Texas A&M University (Class of '22)
While in school, I started a real estate investment company, where I have been working since graduating. Examples of that work are available on my portfolio website.

Active Projects:
Airbnb Data -
 Utilizing econometrics and hierarchical clustering on data from Airbnb listings in order to draw conclusions about hosts, locations, competition, and other factors.
 This is currently a work in progress

Example Projects:

  Gather live data from the YelpAPI, clean, and convert to a Pandas DataFrame. Plotted locations using Folium and manipulated DataFrame to draw conclusions.
